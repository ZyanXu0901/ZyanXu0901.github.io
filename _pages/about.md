Iâ€™m a senior undergraduate at **Southeast University**, about to embark on my PhD journey at the **School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**.

I chase **love, freedom, and excellence** â€” not only in research, but also in life. My work sits at the intersection of **computer security and artificial intelligence**, where curiosity fuels my code and persistence shapes my ideas.

I believe in building things that last, asking questions that matter, and exploring boldly where knowledge has yet to reach.
